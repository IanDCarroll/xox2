# xox2
A PvP Noughts and Crosses Game

## Name origin
The game is named after a contender for the first video game, OXO by Sandy Douglas at Cabridge University in 1952. This being the second construction, it is xox2. The 2 can also be a reference to the fact that unlike the first [xox](https://github.com/IanDCarroll/xox), this one is PvP.

## Ruby Version and Gem Dependencies

This project runs on Ruby 2.4.1. The .rvmrc file automatically switches to that version + a seprate gemset called `xox`

The gem dependencies are `guard-rspec` and `rpsec-given` for test-driving the code.

## How to Run the tests

`$ rspec`
